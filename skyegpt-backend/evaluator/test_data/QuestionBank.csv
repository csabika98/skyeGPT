Do I need to migrate attributes that do not have a default value?,"- Compact database doesn‚Äôt store empty attributes, so there is no need to migrate
- Difference between versions before and after 8.7","# The Why
## Necessity of migration

Innoveo Skye is built on using models that are representing products, processes, organizations, etc. The models (definitions) are prepared by the Business Canvas tool.
Innoveo Skye software on the servers uses the models to create objects (implementations) in which the unique data is stored.
By time, the models change, and this can cause inconsistency with the objects already existing in the database.To overcome this challenge, migration is needed.

# The What
## Compact database

Since Skye 7, there is an option called compact database. If the compact database is enabled, then the attributes without values will not be saved to the database. 
This is implemented on a rather deep (database-connection) layer of the application and works in a way, that if an attribute can not be found in the database, Skye will assume that it is empty.
This is a really big gamechanger for the migration.

### Why is this so important?There are two parts to it.
    
You don‚Äôt have to migrate attributes that do not need to have a value when the implementation is being opened for the first time. If you add an attribute called ‚ÄúcustomerFirstName‚Äù and you expect the customers to fill that information in your next phase, you don‚Äôt have to migrate this attribute, as it is expected to have no value for all the existing implementations.
- A lot of attributes not only do not have but can not have values in the database. You don‚Äôt have to migrate Excel attributes, service attributes, container attributes, basically nothing which does not have the default value option in Skye.
    
It reduces the number of rows required to save an implementation. This is different on every project, but the thumb-rule is that usually, an implementation has 60% fewer rows with this feature enabled. This will reduce your database size by almost 60% which then again will shorten your migration run time exponentially.","Andre Cohen: Everest - Automatic implementation migration is enabled

Where can I find the audit trail logs?,"- Log4j prints it to a separate audit trail log file, in the skye runtime file system
- It can be configured via log4j to also add it to putty and graylog logs by setting the ‚Äúadditivity‚Äù to true (this is not an option via admin console)","# View audit log

Audit trail information is printed by Log4j logger ""skye.audittrail"" using log level INFO.
- It produces log lines in the following format:
Attribute <attribute full text-id path> on implementation <implementation UUID> changed value from <old value> to <new value> at <modification timestamp> by <user role> user <username>.

- Example:
Attribute 'Home.Product.Package' on implementation '8d46aeb7-5af5-421d-a906-c475ccd9314f' changed value from 'super' to 'standard' at 2021-03-04T14:16:52.486Z by 'callcenter' user 'usercc'.

By Skye deployment default, audit log data is written to an audit-trail log file on Skye runtime filesystem.
Upon request, audit log data may also be sent to Graylog. Audit logs may contain sensitive user data, therefore setup in Graylog requires fine-grained user access permission configuration in Graylog.

# Log4j overview

log4j is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework. It is highly configurable through external configuration files at runtime. 
It views the logging process in terms of levels of priorities and offers mechanisms to direct logging information to a great variety of destinations, such as a database, file, console, UNIX Syslog, etc.

log4j has three main components:
   - loggers: Responsible for capturing logging information.
   - appenders: Responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
   - layouts: Responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.
The log4j2.xml file in folder <tomcat>/conf/skye/config configures the logging behavior of Skye

# Skye log4j configuration

The log4j2.xml configuration file is located in /opt/tomcat_<appname>/conf/skye/config and is notified with -Dlog4j.configurationFile parameter to Tomcat.All web applications within the Tomcat instance share the same log4j configuration file, i.e. for Skye User Management the webapps skyeum, skye-admin, idp, and sts all share the same file.

The following chapters describe log4j configuration when debugging some Skye functions, along with example log output. The log4j2.xml configuration file may be adapted manually on a DEV stage for testing and debugging purposes, changes are considered without a Tomcat restart, though still require up to 30 seconds waiting time.

Log examples are displayed to show the output when described loggers are activated. Example log messages contain the log level, the full logger name, and the message","Andre Cohen posted: Audit trail not working

How can I check the indices and extract them to another file format?,"- mention multiple ways to check indices: admin console, API call, putty
- give a high level explanation of how commands exist for checking index contents, copying them into folders on your computer, etc.
- mention the index converter
- be ready to elaborate on parts the user is interested in, based on the link in the next cell","# Step 0: Indentify the indexes

When referring to indexes, we're discussing a dataset uploaded in CSV format via the Admin console. As there's no out-of-the-box method to download it, I'll show you the steps.
Open Putty, connect to the bastion host (jump host), and SSH to the stage you'd like to use. In this example i‚Äôm going to use Hamilton stage, DEV environment.
$ ssh app01.dev.int.hamilton.innoveo-skye.net

You need to identify which index or indexes you'd like to save. To check all available indexes, run the following command:
$ curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_cat/indices""

If you are facing a problem or getting a ‚ÄúConnection refused‚Äù or ‚ÄúCouldn't connect to server‚Äù error, please switch user.
$ sudo su - stagenamedev1a
$ curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_cat/indices""
stagename - Your Skye stage name, for example: everestredev1a or hamiltondev1a
dev1a - Refers to the environment. If you connected to dev, it's dev1a. If you connected to UAT or SIT, it's uat1a or sit1a, respectively.

for example:
I‚Äôm connected to Hamilton stage, DEV environment.
$ sudo su - hamiltondev1a
$ curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/_cat/indices""
Please note that, depending on the stage, the full index name will follow the following pattern: 'stagenamedev1a_indexname'. Hence, you will need to refer to them in this way.

# Step 3: Download the index(es) and save it to your local computer

Simply execute the following command:
$ curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/full_index_name/_search?pretty&size=10000"" >> input.txt
for example:
$ curl -X GET ""localhost:9200/hamiltondev1a_prodcops/_search?pretty&size=10000"" >> input.txt
By using this command, we create a file named 'input.txt' in the stage's storage. It will be located in your default home directory, which corresponds to your Putty username. 

For instance, in my case, it's 'inncssa' at /home/inncssa.
You can ‚Äúvim‚Äù or ‚Äúcat‚Äù to check if the file that we created actually is what we are looking for.
$ vim /home/yourputtyusername/input.txt or cat /home/yourputtyusername/input.txt
for example:
$ vim /home/inncssa/input.txt or cat /home/inncssa/input.txt
In order to download this to your local computer you need to set a tunnel and connect to WinSCP ->(more info how to do that: How to connect to a stage with WinSCP and copy log files or How to connect with WinSCP to a stage)

# Step 4: Convert the downloaded index to CSV and JSON

Is there a way where we can utilize the same process for two different generics? / Can I use the same process for two products?,"On low level, no, you cannot use the same process for two products in Innoveo Skye. Each process is typically tied to a specific product definition, and while you can create similar processes for different products, they must be defined separately.

However, if your intent is to make reusable items then you have some options: 
- For processes that are generic (such as sending emails, or other reusable logic), you can create a single generic definition and use it across multiple products. For example, a generic email process can be configured to send emails for multiple products without duplicating the process for each product. You can also try to use modules.
- You can also clone definitions, it is often used to speed up product configuration. This does mean maintaining separate process definitions for each product.","# Structural embedding

As the name indicates, process definitions are part of the process oriented streams.
A process implementation always references a ""Current process object"" which is either of model type product or generic (in user management: user, user group or generic). 

# How to configure a process
A process definition consists of a root with two mandatory attributes and one brick per process step. Buttons are defined as action attributes on every process step brick. Please find the detailed configuration manual below.

What are the best practices to build integration with Skye?,"Based on the document, best practices for developing integrations include thorough preparation and proactive communication. Start by securing comprehensive API documentation, test credentials, and example requests/responses. If these are missing or incomplete, request them early—lack of this information may signal unpreparedness or low commitment from the provider.

Understand the API protocol (REST, SOAP, etc.), authentication method, and any additional security measures like IP whitelisting. Confirm UAT and production differences, including availability windows and performance guarantees. Clarify which API calls are needed, how frequently they must run, and whether data can be cached or hardcoded (e.g., gender lists).

Validate fields rigorously—look for mandatory inputs, data formats, and hidden business rules. Implement basic validations on your side to reduce dependency on provider-side error handling. Understand how changes in input affect pricing or logic.

Review error structures: inconsistent or poorly formatted errors can disrupt mappings. Evaluate whether data transformations are needed and if Skye can handle them.

Ensure documentation is complete and aligned with the API behavior. Confirm test data coverage and quality. Lastly, identify the API owner and usage context—custom-built APIs may be more flexible but less stable. Maintaining clear, frequent communication with stakeholders throughout the process is essential.","# Purpose 

It is a common requirement from the customer to integrate either with their system(s) or with third parties to insert the application into an ecosystem or extend with functionalities which are not available in Skye. 

#Prerequisites
Before you start the analysis, you need the following:
    - API documentation
    - Sample requests / responses to every API method
    - Test endpoint and credentials

These are quite general and basic needs, if the API provider did not provide them at first, feel free to ask for them. If they are unable or unwilling to provide this in some way, it is an alarming sign.
Either the API is not really ready to be used or the provider is not really committed to have this integration.

#API management
There is a few things, which is good to know about the API. These information can be useful later.
    - Who owns the API? Customer or third party
    - Is the API specifically developed for this project or it is a general purpose API?
        - If the API is developed for you project, you have a higher change to request changes, but the API might be less stable / reliable.
    - Is it an ongoing / recent development or an existing API?
    -  If it is an ongoing / recent development you can expect some changes / issues with the system.
    - Is anyone else using the API right now?

What should I do with my recurring events / tasks after deployment when automigration is turned on with batch?,"Based on the documentation, there is no direct mention of a configuration or option to skip automigration specifically for events during a batch auto-migration. However, the recommended approach is to disable events before starting the batch migration and only re-enable them after the migration is complete. This is to avoid issues with partially migrated data affecting event execution.

Key points from the documentation:
- Before starting batch migration, you should ensure that no recurring events are configured and request infrastructure to stop any JMX jobs related to events.
- Events should remain inactive until the batch migration is completed.
- After migration, you can re-enable events and resume normal operations.","Batch
Implementations can also be migrated as part of a batch process, running on the admin application as a background thread, iterating over each outdated implementation and migrating it. This process may run over long periods of time, generally without affecting the normal operation of the system, although there are some limitations and exception cases that should be considered, which are described in more detail in Limitations and best practices.

In deployment scenarios with Freetext re-indexing and Skye event runs, it is beneficial to not activate batch auto-migration but trigger automatic migration manually through JMX after re-indexing and event runs. With automatic migration enabled, on re-indexing or event run, implementations are migrated on-the-fly. 

The batch migration is separated into different jobs. Each job migrates all outdated implementations associated only with one particular definition version. More than one job might be created if there are multiple definitions or implementations in different source versions for the same definition. The jobs are queued and run one at a time.

The progress of each job and other migration-related metrics can be monitored with JMX.

Sometimes, even though the definition changed, there are no structural changes (e.g. the case of modifying a text). In these cases, the implementations ‘definition versions’ still need to be updated to the current one but no further modifications are needed. To accomplish this without incurring the overhead cost of loading each implementation, a different type of job is launched which doesn’t load the implementations into memory.","Bharath A: Auto-Migration, https://innoveo.atlassian.net/browse/SKYE-11568"

How does flexdata search filtering work?,"Based on the text provided, Flexdata search filtering utilizes wildcard characters to refine search results within Flexdata attributes.

Two types of wildcards are supported:

Asterisk (*): This matches any number of characters. For example, searching *er in Flexdata would return results like ""Software engineer"" and ""QA engineer"". Searching So* would return ""Software engineer"".
Question Mark (?): This matches exactly one character in a specific position. For instance, searching b?ll could return ""bell"", ""bill"", and ""ball"".
By using these wildcards, users can make their searches within Flexdata attributes more flexible, allowing them to find relevant information even when they don't know the exact term or want to match variations.","# Overview

Wildcards are special characters that can be used in search terms to represent one or more other characters. Wildcards can be useful in improving search results.
The use of wildcard characters, specifically '*', and '?', is now feasible within the following Skye search components:
    - Free text search
    - Automatic search queries
    - Flexdata attributes
    - Reference attributes

# Supported wildcards

Skye search components support the following wildcard characters:
    Asterisk (*) - matches any number of characters (wh* will return what, why and where)
    Question mark (?) - matches any single character in a specific position (b?ll will return bell, bill and ball)

# Example
(Examples are given for the following dataset: Software engineer & QA engineer)

    - Search query: *er
    Flexdata: Software engineer, QA engineer

    - Search query: So*
    Flexdata: Software engineer

    - Search query: engin?er
    Flexdata: Software engineer, QA engineer


Single search field	Defines the single field in which the search should be executed in case of input type ""Auto complete"". If no single search field is defined, the search is executed in all index fields.	No	(none)	No	-

Reference attributes are used to link implementations. Some of them are set automatically at creation time of an implementation structure, others are set by configuration. References between implementations are needed in order to use values of attributes of one implementation in the other one. Therefore it is possible to navigate through implementation references via dependencies, excels and variable resolver expressions.

# Reference attribute properties

Property: Set Reference
Description:
Defines how a reference can be set if it is not done by a user via the user interface (e.g. by dependency, excel etc.). The effective value of the reference attribute is not affected by this property. It is always ""{rootUUID};{rootUUID}"".

Set reference by UUID
If this option is chosen, the UUID of the implementation root to be referenced must be set as value in the following format: {rootUUID};{rootUUID} in order to set the reference.

Set reference by @CustomId
If this option is chosen, the value that is set must be equal to the value of the attribute ""@CustomId"" on an implementation of a model text-id specified below in order to set the reference.
Mandatory: Yes
Default value: by UUID
Example: by @CustomId

# The value of a reference attribute

The value of a reference attribute is the concatenation of the root uuid and the brick uuid (or again the root uuid if the reference points to the root) separated by "";"". This is also true if the reference is set via @CustomId! 
- {rootUUID};{brickUUID}
- {rootUUID};{rootUUID}",Istv√°n Varga: Reference autocomplete with no restrictions is not returning details...
Is it possible to navigate from one process into an another and load the implementation's data?,"This is possible in Skye by using URLs. There should be an action button with exit process navigation properties. Also a redirect URL control attribute needed in the process step. 
The redirect URL should contain the new process enter and use the ""data"" or ""action"" parameter. Make sure the data is encrypted by using 'encrypt' function resolver.","# Load implementations

To start a process and load an existing implementation either the parameter 'data' or 'uuid' have to be used:

Process layout: internal and public
data: /page/{channel}/{language}/{country}/process/enter/{processId}?data=%encrypt('load=source:%{modelTextId->uuid}')&activeZone={zoneId}
uuid: /page/{channel}/{language}/{country}/process/enter/{processId}?uuid=%encrypt('%{modelTextId->uuid}')&activeZone={zoneId}

Process layout: standalone
data: /page/{channel}/{language}/{country}/component/process?processId={processId}&data=%encrypt('load=source:%{modelTextId->uuid}')
uuid: /page/{channel}/{language}/{country}/component/process?processId={processId}&uuid=%encrypt('%{modelTextId->uuid}')

##Example
https://training10.innoveo.com/page/callcenter/en/us/process/enter/HomeCreatePolicy?data=%encrypt('load=source:%{Home->uuid}')&activeZone=myproduct

## Explanations

- data: Parameter which has to be used together with the uuid of the implementation to be loaded.
The part which is loaded needs to be encrypted, meaning the function resolver %encrypt() has to be used. (Possible to combine this parameter with action parameters like e.g. 'copyAndLoad', 'set', 'setReferences' or 'createBricks'. See chapters below)
-uuid: Parameter which loads an implementation given its uuid. 


The most common problem with an autosearch is that you think there are implementations that should be visible but for some reason, they don’t appear.

Delete Default Authorization Model from the stage and only activate it back once there are implementations visible.

Check if there are really implementations that should be visible

check the values in DB

change the query so it searches for everything (I believe QUERY:() should work)

Make sure there are no inconsistent implementation that breaks the whole search

delete all implementations of the definition

create one new implementation which should be visible

if this is not an option, try to reindex the definition

This is not a joke, sometimes your browser caches the search and does not realize that you changed the definitions.
The part which is loaded needs to be encrypted, meaning the function resolver %encrypt() has to be used. (Not possible to combine this parameter with other action parameters.)",
I am generating documents using a PrintService attribute on a generic definition. How can I access the datas that are on the product definition and print them onto the document?,"You can access the datas on the product definition by using a reference attribute. Reference attributes pick up UUIDs as values, so you can map the generic's UUID to the created reference attribute on the product definition. Depending on your solution, you can do it in the opposite way as well.","Generating Documents
# Overview

Innoveo Skye offers XSLT-FOP based document generation and document archive functionalities out of the box. It also offers the possibility to extract template definitions, images, styles and font definition in to a common definition for reuse across products.  

Apache‚Ñ¢ FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting pages to a specified output. Innoveo Skye leverages the power of FOP to generate document that can output target as PDF.

The documents are generated on demand, meaning that it is generated when the user click on a document link. There are distinct URL‚Äôs for document generation with or without persisting or with attachment to an email.

# Adding content from attributes navigating through references and back references 

In the following example,  two attributes are included coming from a navigation through a back reference (firstName, lastName), and an attribute is included from a navigation through a reference. 

To include external attributes, all of them (references, back references and attributes) need to have visibility read in the printing context.
```
        <fo:block>
               First name from back ref:
              <xsl:for-each select=""//attribute-lines[*/id = 'Travel-myBackRef-Home-Customer-firstName']/right-column-attribute"">      
              - <xsl:value-of select=""value-text""/> 
              </xsl:for-each>
           </fo:block>
            <fo:block>
           Last name from back ref:  
               <xsl:for-each select=""//attribute-lines[*/id = 'Travel-myBackRef-Home-Customer-lastName']/right-column-attribute"">      
              - <xsl:value-of select=""value-text""/>
